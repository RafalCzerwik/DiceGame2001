# Dice Game 2001

Dice Game 2001 is a classic dice game where players roll two standard six-sided dice in an attempt to be the first to reach 2001 points.

## How to Play

1. Each player starts with a score of 0.
2. On their turn, a player rolls 2 dice.
3. The total number from the dice roll is added to their score.
4. Starting from the second round:
    - If a player rolls a total of 7, their score is divided by 7 (fractional parts discarded).
    - If a player rolls a total of 11, their score is multiplied by 11.
5. The game ends when a player reaches 2001 points or more.

In this implementation, you will play against the computer. After your roll, the computer will automatically take its turn. The current scores are displayed after each round.
